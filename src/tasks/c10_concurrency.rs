// Implement a `SharedCounter` struct with one `value: ?<i32>` field and methods:
// - `pub fn new(initial_value: i32) -> Self`, which creates a new instance of the `SharedCounter`.
// - `pub fn increment(&self)` which will increment the internal value.
// - `pub fn get_value(&self) -> i32` which will return the internal value.
//
// Notice that these methods could be called from the several threads at the same time. Use `Arc`
// and `Mutex` where needed.

// Simulate a bank account system with concurrent deposits and withdrawals.
//
// Implement a `BankAccount` struct with one `balance: ?<i32>` field and methods:
// - `pub fn new(initial_balance: i32) -> Self`, which creates a new instance of the `BankAccount`.
// - `pub fn deposit(&self, amount: i32)` which adds the provided amount to the balance.
// - `pub fn withdraw(&self, amount: i32) -> bool` which attempts to remove the provided amount from
//   the balance. If the balance have sufficient funds, it removes the provided amount and returns
//   `true`, otherwise returns `false`.
// - `pub fn get_balance(&self)` which returns the current balance.

// Notice that these methods could be called from the several threads at the same time. Use `Arc`
// and `Mutex` where needed.

// ----- 6 --------------------------------------
// Implement a work queue where multiple workers consume tasks and send results back (a simple task
// distribution system).
//
// You will need to implement two procedures:
// - `worker(id: usize, task_receiver: ?<Receiver<i32>>, result_sender: ?<Sender<(usize, i32)>>)`,
//   which has the ID of the worker, the task receiver, which waits for the task to be provided to
//   this worker, and the result sender, which sends the computed result back to the main thread.
//   This procedure should:
//   - Loop over all incoming tasks from `task_receiver`.
//   - For each task, compute the square of the value this task provided.
//   - Send the result back via `result_sender` along with the workerâ€™s ID:
//    `(worker_id, result_value)`.
//   - Decide by your own whether this procedure should return something or not, and if should --
//    what exactly.
//   - Use `Arc` or `Mutex` if needed.
// - `run_work_queue(tasks: Vec<i32>, number_of_workers: usize) -> Vec<(usize, i32)>` which has the
//   vector of tasks (just values, which square we should compute) and the total number of workers
//   which should be spawned. It returns the vector of worker IDs (`usize`) and the resulting value
//   computed by this worker (`i32`). This procedure should:
//   - Create two channels: for sending tasks to workers and for collecting results from workers.
//   - For each worker spawn a thread which runs the worker function, consuming tasks and sending
//     results.
//   - Send each task from the input list into the task_sender.
//   - Collect all results from the result_receiver into a vector and return it.
